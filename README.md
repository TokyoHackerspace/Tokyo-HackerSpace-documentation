# Tokyo-HackerSpace-documentation
Wiki repository for all manuals and documentation for Tokyo HackerSpace

The goal of this repository is to migrate the old documentation from the THS website wiki.
This should allow us to open the wiki to more contributors, using github for more secure authentication, to ultimately achieve more and fresher content.
